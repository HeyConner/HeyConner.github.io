          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Conner Belvin and I moved to Vancouver Washington 3 years ago when we didnt have to watch over my grandmother anymore (R.I.P Grandma). I then met some of my closest friends who turned out to be aspiring web developers. They are the guys who i go to when i get in a slight jam. Im very excited to finish the school im going to. Its a vocational school in portland where aspiring web developers come to expand there knowledge on the subject and start to expand their connections in the tech world.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up my entire life thinking that it wasnt cool to the ladies if you had anything to do with computers. I now know that i couldnt have been more wrong. I grew up playing baseball with my best friend in Puyallup Washington and many other places throughout the state because we were on travel teams. We jumped from team to team because all of the parents were just too toxic for our parents to handle. My friend (Garrett) and I would come onto a new team and start taking positions from the other players because we were versatile utilitys. Like I mentioned before, the one thing that really held our family in Puyallup was my grandmother. She got sick with cancer right around 2008. She stuck it out and stayed strong until the very beggining of 2010. When she passed my family wanted to move south to become closer to other family members that we only saw occasionally.

        <h2>Education/Relationships</h2>
        <p>
          During my residence in Vancouver so far, I have went to Thomas Jefferson middle school for 8th grade, and then continued my education into Columbia River High School. I had plans for college after High School, but my college scholarship/ financial i was promised in 8th grade was pulled from me because my dad got a new job and we made too much money for me to continue to hold that scholarship. So that and the influence from my friends really led me to web development. Now I am attending Epicodus programming school in Portland and I think I have made a very good carrer choice/life decision in doing that.

        <h3>My Pet</h3>
        <p>
        I have a super cool cat. Honestly the nicest and softest can I have ever met. He is a White Ragdoll breed. So he is extremely fluffy and he doesn't shed! He likes to eat and sleep wrapped around my neck every night, which is probably really comfortable for him, but not so much myself.

        <h3>My Experience with Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          Coding is a wonderful and exciting thing to learn. I am having way more fun learning it at this school than i was trying to teach myself. I can't wait to have the front end side of things mastered so eventually i can become a full stack developer and work with my friends! if you are ever considering changing carrer paths or just looking for a new exciting hobby to spice up your life alittle bit, then you and your          loved ones should learn to stroke the keys and come join epicodus.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          I have a few hobbys in case you were wondering. I really enjoy hanging out with my beautiful girlfriend. Going on dates and taking her to dinner are really where i find most of the joy in my life! But when she is too busy for me, i like going and playing spikeball (variation of volleyball) with my closest friends, or playing League of Legends, the best game ever made.
